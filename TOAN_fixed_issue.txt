1. { [Error: Cannot find module '../build/Release/bson'] code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND' }
js-bson: Failed to load c++ bson extension, using pure JS version

==> resolve

When you install the mongoose module by npm, it does not have a built bson module in it's folder. In the file node_modules/bson/ext/index.js, change the line

bson = require('../build/Release/bson');
to

bson = require('bson');
and then install the bson module using npm.
